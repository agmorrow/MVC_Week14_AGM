## Description
I was given a task to build a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publush their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. This project was build from scratch and is deployed to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its archiectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.
